App created to learn React JS
The idea of an app was made by my hobby and current car project of matching E39 530i with 6 speed gearbox to check what results should i expect

Main utility is calculating speed of a vehicle based on given data
-tire size
-transmision number of gears and ratios
-differential ratio 
-Engine RPM

The app gives speed on each gear based on given data aswell as engine RPM at given cruise speed
You can also change units of speed (km/h or mph)

App expansion ideas
*expansion of app to make it bigger car related app

*more settings of transmision
-adding and deleting gears
-saving and loading presets using local storage

*new tab of wheel size comparison

*dark/light mode
